<p> My grandmothers medicine is produced and given only in syrup and is prepared ayurvedically at home.It is for children who have less growth and gives energy to play</p>

<p>My grandmother serves it to people who drink it at my grandma's home she puts it into a cup so the people can drink and go and then you must listen to her instructions on how much days after you need to come to take it again take it for 1 month and you will see that it actually helps kids and ladies very well and then pay some money and leave and she puts the syrup in the leaf of mango tree then folds it into a leaf and packs it in a sheet of paper for people who take it home to drink later on </p>

<p> My grandmother serves it only on thursday's and saturday's every week</p>
